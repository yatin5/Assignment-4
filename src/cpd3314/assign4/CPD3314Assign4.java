     * Exercise #2 & 3 - Distance Traveled File
     * 
     * The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
     *     Distance = Speed * Time
     * For example, if a train travels 40 miles-per-hour for three hours, the 
     * distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks for the speed 
     * of a vehicle (in miles-per-hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. 
     * It should use a loop to display the distance a vehicle has traveled for 
     * each hour of a time period specified by the user. For example, if a 
     * vehicle is traveling at 40mph for a three-hour time period, it should 
     * output a report similar to the one that follows to a file named 
     * "ex3output.txt":

     * accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.
